# truth-table-generator
A java project where the goal is to generate a correctly evaluated truth table based of an input expression given by the user.

I think almost every computer engineer is tired of writing out truth tables to be able to evaluate a boolean expression, but this generator solves this for you!

At the moment the generator only works by the user entering a string into the "TruthTable" constructor in the main method in the TruthTableGenerator source file and then by running the program, where the string is the expression to be evaluated. I'm going to add a simple UI using swing and also plan to add Karnaugh diagrams and expression simplification to help with that tedious task as well.
